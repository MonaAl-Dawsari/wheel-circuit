# wheel-circuit


This repo contains a task to design and program a wheels circuit  for base robot  during internship at smart method company. 
## Steps 
* Create an account on [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com) and use these components: <br>
1- Arduino Uno 3 <br>
2-small breadboard <br>
3- power supply -12volt- <br> 
4-DC Motor <br>
5- l293 h bridge <br>



* Design the circuit as shown in the picture.

These picture show the Pin for the h bridge and how can we connect cables

* Program the arduino to Set the Speeds to 120 - you can change the Speeds var to the Speeds you want- using c++ language. ([see the code](https://github.com/MonaAl-Dawsari/wheel-circuit/blob/main/wheel_circuit.ino))

* Start Simulation.
